I'm a CS PhD Student/Researcher at Georgia Tech and I'm privileged to be a part of the Embedded Pervasive Lab ([EPL](https://epl.gatech.edu)). I'm advised by [Dr. Kishore Ramachandran](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~rama/).

I received my MS CS from Georgia Tech and my Bachelors degree in CS from Manipal University.

My interests range from Systems, Distributed Sytems & Networking with an emphasis on deterministic, efficient and performant use of resources which are essential for Edge Computing applications. I am particularly interested in (1) optimizing resource scheduling on single node systems & (2) improving the state-of-the-art (SotA) in resource orchestration in geo-distributed cluster environments in the context of emerging applications that move computations closer to the end user (for e.g., Autonomous Driving Systems, Industrial automation, Collaborative AR etc). I've been fortunate to work with talented peers at EPL in projects aimed at solving the research challenges faced by Edge Computing applications.

I volunteer my spare time as the Student & Faculty Affairs Chair with the Graudate Student Association for the School of Computer Science ([SCS GSA](https://scsgsa.cc.gatech.edu/)) to help improve graduate student wellbeing and experience.

I also love cooking and enjoy learning the science behind food. I'm quite proud I bake my own (sourdough) bread!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
